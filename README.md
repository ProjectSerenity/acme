# acme
Go port of Rob Pike's Acme editor, based on the implementation in plan9port.

## Plan of Attack

- [ ] Port libframe
    - [x] Transliterate libframe from plan9port
    - [ ] Refactor into more idiomatic Go
    - [ ] Verify and Test
- [ ] Port Acme
    - [ ] Transliterate acme from plan9port
    - [ ] Refactor into more idiomatic Go
    - [ ] Verfiy and Test

## Contributions

Contributions are very welcome. Just submit a pull request and we'll review the code before merging it in. I intend to handle the bulk of the transliteration myself, but contributions for the refactor into idiomatic Go are more than welcome.

Project needs work. But I knew that.
